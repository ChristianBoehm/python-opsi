Building python-opsi on OBS
===========================

The packages for opsi and it's components are build on the
`OpenSUSE Build Service <https://build.opensuse.org/>`_ (short: _OBS_).

We usually target the currently maintained releases of Debian, Ubuntu,
Univention Corporate Server (UCS), Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL),
CentOS, Suse Linux Enterprise Server and openSUSE.
Fedora is currently not officially supported but we may provide support
in future versions.

The repositories we provide on OBS should contain all requirements that
are needed to build and run opsi. If software is provided in the default
repositories of a distribution we make use of this unless we require
newer versions.
